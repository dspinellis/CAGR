Introduction
============
The GIMP image manipulation package.  Various versions from 1998-2011 accumulated
and analysed.

This growth is relatively continuous with an early blip due to code refactoring by the
looks of it.  Thirteen versions were extracted from 1.0.0 to 2.7.0.  All use the
same method of source distribution with a README file.

Means of production
===================
The data is mined from the source .bz2 files using:-

% make_gimp_csv.sh

The files are shown below.

make_gimp_csv.sh
++++++++++++++++
#!/bin/sh
#    Fiendish script to unravel a GIMP bz2 archive, count the lines in it
#    and then use stat to read the date from the README file.
#
out=gimp_c.csv

versions=`ls *.bz2`
for version in $versions
do
     echo "Handling $version"

     echo "... unzipping $version"
     bunzip2   $version

     tarname=`basename $version .bz2`
     echo "... untarring $tarname"
     tar xf - <     $tarname

     dirname=`basename $tarname .tar`
     echo "... counting lines for $dirname"
     totcount=0
     for file in `find "$dirname" -name '*.[cChH]' -print`
     do
          count=`wc -l < "$file"`
          totcount=`expr $totcount + $count`
     done
#
#    Output information grabbing a date
#
     MODDATE=$(stat -c %y $dirname/README)
     MODDATE=${MODDATE%% *}
     echo "$MODDATE,$totcount"          >> $out
#
#    Return to original condition.
#
     echo "... removing $dirname"
     rm -rf    $dirname
     echo "... zipping $tarname"
     bzip2     $tarname
done
